1. TO build - perform mvn clean install
2. to run mvn spring-boot:run

Things I have done here

1 . Have written complete API for finding sum pair that equal give target.
2. Once the spring boot is started, http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html  for API Reference
3. Haved added postman collection so we can run it - KohlsTarget.postman_collection.json is in root dir
4. Unit test for coverage - started but cannot complete due to lack of time as I am busy with work. Requirement is to write API
but have given the intention to write unit test.
4. curlscript.sh contains all the postman test as a script which can be run from the command line. The run is given here

[2,5,7,9,8,-1], target = 15
{"solution":[2,4]}
[-2,-5,-7,9,8,-1], target=7
{"solution":[0,3]}
[-2, -5, -7, -9, -8, -1], target = -3
{"solution":[0,5]}
[1, 3, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 3, 4], target = 6
{"solution":[0,4]}
[ 3, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 3], target = 6 / no solution since numbers are reqd to be distinct
